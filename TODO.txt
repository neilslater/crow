TODO:

  NArray confirm sub-types
    sint = 16-bit
    lint = 32-bit ?

  ruby_class_dataset.c template support:
    params for initialize
    clone
    accessors and mutators
      direct
      pointers
      NArrays

  Cover different constructions of rank, shape
    1. From constants - defined in .h and used in .c
    2. Shape built from expressions - needs temp var

  Specs
    - How to do test at all?

  Integration type - extendable (written once then edited) versus maintained (separate written files that can be over-written)

  Different class names to struct names

  Handle deeper class names


require 'crow'
m = Crow::LibDef.new( 'the_module', {
  :structs => [
    { :name => 'hello',
      :attributes => [{:name=>'hi',:ctype=>:NARRAY_INT_32 }],
      :init_params => [{:name=>'n',:ctype=>:int }]
    }
  ]
} )
m.structs.first.write( '/tmp' )
