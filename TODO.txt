TODO:

  NArray confirm sub-types

  Cover different constructions of rank, shape
    1. From constants - defined in .h and used in .c
    2. Shape built from expressions - needs temp var

  ruby_class_dataset.c template support:
    params for initialize
    clone
    accessors and mutators
      direct
      pointers
      NArrays

  Specs
    - How to do test at all?

  Integration type - extendable (written once then edited) versus maintained (separate written files that can be over-written)

  Different class names to struct names

  Handle deeper class names
